Testing Parameters and Disclaimer

The following tests of silicone eartips are based on my evaluations and listening observations. All test are conducted in a quiet listening environment. Fit is ensured such that eartips are properly inserted and seated into the ear canal with good seal. I have to elaborate, your experiences may vary.


Associated equipment list: Sources – Luxury & Precision W4, Questyle M15 and Sony WM-A105. IEMs – 7Hz Timeless, 7Hz Salnotes Zero, 7Hz Sonus, Tanchjim Oxygen and Moondrop Blessing 2.


Disclaimer: All scores are subjected to change without notice. I may update or add new scores every few months when I acquire new eartips.


NOTE: I don’t have favorite eartips but if I want neutrality, SpinFits CP-145 is my first pick usually. For IEM tuning, I always use reversed KZ Starline, follow by stock eartips from the manufacturer.

Acoustune AEX07

Bore size: regular
Stem length: regular
Feel: sturdy and firm
Bass: 3.50
Midrange: 5.00
Treble: 4.25
Soundstage: 3.75
Vocal presence: 4.00

For neutral tonality with emphasis in midrange. The AEX07 sounds closer to AET07a than AET07. Improved overall tonal texture and clarity over the latter. Note weight is is denser than AET07a however it sounds less congested than AET07. A good middle-ground between its two predecessors. My new favorite Acoustune eartip.

What was Acoustune thinking when they came out these?! 

These eartips are “directional” (meaning you must wear them in a certain way) and a pain in the butt to put on. You need lots of patience and time to get them to sit well inside the ears. Getting the proper “ear seal” is nearly impossible. There is literally zero isolation. The design adopts a WW2 helmet-like umbrella shape with double “wings” design. The wide wing is to face the inner-part of the entrance to the ear canal, and the narrow wing facing out (see attached photos).

eartips 1

Unfortunately, I couldn’t get them to fit in my ears properly not matter how hard I tried. Although made of soft memory polymer, they become uncomfortable, irritating and warm inside my ears after a while.

Sound-wise, these eartips thin the sound so much that they make your TOTL IEMs sound like 1950s transistor radio. Everything sounds distant, lean and sibilance.

Acoustune AEX70
Bore size: regular
Stem length: regular
Feel: soft and pliable
Bass: 3.50
Midrange: 4.50
Treble: 4.25
Soundstage: 4.25
Vocal presence: 4.00

Another addition to the new Acoustune AEX family. To me, these sound the most open and airy among the AEX members. Tonality and note weight are lighter than AEX07, as well as the older AET07. Overall, the AEX70 sounds cleaner and clearer than both AEX07 and AET07.

ADV Eartune Fidelity U Elliptical Silicone Eartips (horizontal fit)
Bore size: small (4mm)
Stem length: short
Feel: flexible, soft and pliable
Bass: 3.5
Midrange: 4
Treble: 3.5
Soundstage: 2.5
Vocal presence: 3.5
An interesting elliptical eartip which fits two ways and can affect sound. The not so interesting part is it projects a smaller soundstage and vocals get thrown backwards. In both fittings, I experienced quite significant treble roll-off and details lost. Isolation is NOT GOOD!

Midrange: 5.0
Treble: 4
Soundstage: 3.75
Vocal presence: 5.0
Yes, it is called “anti-allergenic sleeves”. If you can find these at your local earphone stores, GET IT! These sound extremely close to Azla SednaEarFit XELASTEC but at half the cost. If you are not used to the grippiness or tackiness of the XELASTEC, AKG is the best alternative. Vocal is forward with very good dimension and ambience. 3D. Best of all it doesn’t affect bass and treble.
Purchase from a friend who bought from AKG outlet in Germany

ALPEX Hi-Unit HSE-A1000
Bore size: wide
Stem length: short
Feel: soft and pliable
Bass: 4.25
Midrange: 4.25
Treble: 4.50
Soundstage: 4.0
Vocal presence: 4.25
These wide bore eartips bear an uncanny resemblance to JVC Spiral Dot in look but they don’t sound alike. The HSE-A1000 is brighter, more open and livelier. Midrange has more sparkle and life. The bass is cleaner, tighter and more textured. Best of all, they cost only a fraction of the JVC. I am surprised how good these are. What a hidden gem!

Audiosense S400 Soft Silicone Eartips
Bore size: regular
Stem length: short
Feel: flexible and firm
Bass: 4.25
Midrange: 5.0
Treble: 4.0
Soundstage: 4.0
Vocal presence: 4.5
Both Baskingshark and Vannak Pech are fans of this eartip. It adds “round-meatiness” (a.k.a smoothness and body) to the music without clouding the low-mids. Vocals can be a tad forward but still very pleasant. I would rank its sonic signatures between SpinFit CP-145 and Final Audio Type E eartips. Similar to SpinFits, it has a pivoting cap design.
Purchased from Audiosense Official Store on AliExpress

Audio-Technica FineFit ER-CKM55M

Azla SednaEarFit Crystal (Standard)

Bore size: regular
Stem length: regular
Feel: soft, grippy and sticky
Bass: 3.5
Midrange: 5.0
Treble: 4.25
Soundstage: 4.0
Vocal presence: 5.0

Another pricey eartip offering from Azla. Feels just like XELASTEC. Both XELASTEC and Crystal excel in the midrange and vocals. Their most obvious differences are in the upper-mids and mid-bass range where Crystal adds a touch more instrument presence, separation and space. Mid-bass is cleaner and clearer than XELASTEC yet doesn’t sacrifice warmth and body. It is good to note that Crystal does not have the upper-midrange “ringing” that plagues XELASTEC.
Purchased from Amazon Japan

Azla SednaEarfit Crystal (for TWS)
Bore size: regular
Stem length: short
Feel: soft, grippy and sticky
Bass: 3.5
Midrange: 5.0
Treble: 4.25
Soundstage: 4.0
Vocal presence: 5.0

Another pricey eartip offering from Azla. Feels similar to XELASTEC but with a shallower in-ear fit. Both XELASTEC and Crystal excel in the midrange and vocals. Their most obvious differences are in the upper-mids and mid-bass range where Crystal adds a touch more instrument presence, separation and space. Mid-bass is cleaner and clearer than XELASTEC yet doesn’t sacrifice warmth and body. It is good to note that Crystal does not have the upper-midrange “ringing” that plagues XELASTEC. Can be used for both IEM and TWS.

Azla SednaEarfit Foamax (Standard)
Bore size: wide bore with Waxguard.
Stem length: regular
Feel: medium density firmness and spongy

Bass: 4.50
Midrange: 5.00
Treble: 4.00
Soundstage: 3.50
Vocal presence: 5.00

I came across the SednaEarfit Foamax ear tips and was intrigued by users who claimed they were a superior alternative to the significantly more expensive Sony EP-NI1000M. If these claims hold true, Azla could have a major success on their hands.

In terms of sound quality, the SednaEarfit Foamax offers a crisper and clearer soundscape compared to the Sony. Vocals are more prominent and detailed, and the treble boasts a touch more vibrancy. However, the bass performance and soundstage are largely comparable between the two.

The SednaEarfit Foamax feels softer and plusher than the Sony, thanks to its slow rebound foam that regains its shape completely within 30 seconds. Additionally, the built-in mesh avoids causing any discomfort to the ear canal, unlike the Comply’s own Waxguard.

So, is the SednaEarfit Foamax better than the Sony EP-NI1000M? While I believe they offer a compelling alternative at a significantly lower price point, I personally favor the Sony’s more balanced sound signature. Nevertheless, considering they cost slightly more than half the price of the Sony, SednaEarfit Foamax is definitely worth considering.

Azla SednaEarfit Max ASMR (Standard)
Bore size: narrow bore with Waxguard, short cap
Stem length: regular
Feel: firm and flexible

Bass: 4.50
Midrange: 4.50
Treble: 3.50
Soundstage: 3.25
Vocal presence: 5.00

This eartip, the narrow bore version of the SednaEarFit Max, offers a distinct variation within the family. Compared to its sibling, SednaEarFit Max ASMR tightens the sound, resulting in a smaller perceived soundstage. However, it compensates with a more precise and focused sonic image. Additionally, it delivers superior tonal density, improved textural clarity, and richer vocals. As the name suggests, vocals are emphasized and brought forward in the mix, creating a sense of intimacy. However, there is a trade-off in the form of reduced treble extension and a lack of high-frequency sparkle. This translates to a smoother and more natural but potentially less detailed listening experience overall.

Azla SednaEarfit ORIGIN for In-Ear Monitor & TWS
Bore size: regular, tapered to a wide opening
Stem length: long
Feel: firm and flexible

Bass: 5.00
Midrange: 4.50
Treble: 3.50
Soundstage: 4.00
Vocal presence: 4.75

The ORIGIN eartips are, without a doubt, the most bass-forward I’ve ever encountered. But fear not, bassheads, because this is a good thing! They deliver a satisfying low-end rumble that’s surprisingly free from bloat and muddiness. While they might not pack the same punchy, dynamic punch as the Penon Audio Liqueur black eartips, the ORIGIN compensates with a smooth, fluid presentation for vocals, offering a truly captivating listening experience. However, there’s a catch. While the lower frequencies are a feast, the upper treble frequencies exhibit a slight roll-off, meaning they lack some sparkle and airiness. So, if you crave razor-sharp highs, these might not be your best bet. Overall, if you’re a bass aficionado who values smooth vocals, the ORIGIN eartips are definitely worth considering. They excel at creating a rich and immersive listening experience, but may not be the ideal choice for those seeking a more analytical or balanced sound signature. Perfect eartips pairing for Simgot IEMs especially with EA1000.

Bass: 3.75
Midrange: 4.50
Treble: 3.75
Soundstage: 3.75

Imagine the SednaEarFit Regular but with the stem chopped down a bit. These shorter SednaEarFits bring the music closer to your ears, making everything sound crisper, clearer and a bit more forward. They offer a similar experience to the SednaEarFit Light Short but with a delicate overall sound.

A “short-stem” version of SednaEarFitLight. Both nozzles are brought closer to the eardrums thus enhancement in overall clarity and vocal presence, which means stereo image and presentation are slightly more forward.

Another highly-requested eartips from the audiophile community. However, just like its TWS sibling, these are not my favorite! First of all, their fitting is awful. It is too short for my ear canal. Second, I am not a fan of having waxguard inside the nozzle. And finally, why people like these are the main reasons for my dislikes. They introduce too much bass and mid-bass boost. The treble clarity and extension are suppressed and restricted. Vocals have a thick nasally undertone and are pushed forward. Overall, these present an average tonality that is surpassed by many cheaper eartips. If you haven’t purchased these, save your money. Azla SednaEarFit (Light) Short is better. It is another déjà vu moment for me with SednaEarfit Max series.

Midrange: 4.50

At first glance, these look like colourful version of SednaEarFitLight Short. Upon close examination, they are very different in looks, feel and sound. SednaEarFit Vivid Edition feels softer and plusher. It has a narrower bore and sounds livelier than SednaEarFit Light Short. Bass is punchier, better texture and definition. Vocals sound cleaner, clearer and slightly forward. Upper-registers are brighter and slightly more extended than SednaEarFitLight Short. This eartips definitely deserve the “Vivid Edition” title. Not suitable for bright or shouty IEMs.

The most expensive eartip in my collection. Isolation is impeccable. If you love vocals, THIS IS IT! Vocal presence is extremely 3D. Best of all it doesn’t affect bass and treble. Projects soundstage a bit narrower than regular SednaEarFit.

Compared to its predecessor, XELASTEC II offers a less sticky, dust-resistant surface. The flexible Waxguard improves the sound with smoother treble and reduced upper-midrange glare, all while preserving the core strengths of the original. For fans of the original XELASTEC who prefer a less sticky feel, XELASTEC II is the perfect choice.

Suspiciously similar to Acoustune AET07. Heck… It sounds closer to AET07a than AET07. Neutral tonality with emphasis in midrange and top-end sparkle. I find this eartip to have better bass texture, dynamics and vocal presence than SpinFit CP100 and CP145.

Treble: 4.25
Soundstage: 4.0
Vocal presence: 4.0This eartip comes stock with BGVP ArtMagic VG4, ArtMagic V12 and DH3, labeled under “vocal” eartip. Highly-praised by Singaporean audiophile Reza Emmanuel as his standard reference, I must say this eartip is extremely comfortable, literally fatigue-free for long listening sessions.

Sound is clean, tight and very well-textured. Bass and low-mids are detailed, punchy and dynamic. Midrange is clear with excellent separation. Upper-mids and treble are smooth and extended with good amount of air and spacial cues. Vocal position is ‘just nice” – that is neither too forward nor too laid-back. Soundstage is realistically wide without sounding too spread-out. Similar to SpinFit, this eartip comes with a pivoting umbrella/cap.
Specially-ordered from BGVP Taobao Official Store as they do not sell this eartip individually.

Canyon is a German company however these eartips are made in China. Interestingly, I find these eartips very pleasing, especially in staging. The ET400 is laid back yet retains imaging scale and focus very well. Although the packaging says “bass”, the ET400 isn’t bassy or rumbly. I would classify it as balanced with a touch of midrange warmth.

An interesting audiophile’s “sanitary” product from Japan, and made in Japan. How true is the anti-bacteria, anti-microbial and anti-virus properties I don’t know (it comes in a plastic “petri dish”) but I do know these eartips roll-off treble and thicken bass and mid-bass. You lose clarity but gain body and smoothness. Recommended for bright and harsh sounding IEMs.

A slightly more bassy version of Acoustune AET08. The ST35 has solid and punchy bass, full-bodied midrange and good vocal presence. Nonetheless, it has a slightly rolled-off treble. Similar to the AET08, soundstage and stereo imaging are average. Instruments and voices are tad front forward but non-offensive. It has a pivoting umbrella just like SpinFits. Comes in a nice plastic storage case with 3 pairs of your chosen size.

Divinus MOCHI TIP (for IEM/TWS)

Stem length: very short
Feel: soft, elastic and pliable
Bass: 3.50
Midrange: 5.00
Treble: 4.50
Soundstage: 5.00
Vocal presence: 4.50

These eartips have an extremely shallow fit due to their noticeably short stem. They produce a very midrange-forward sound with suppressed mid-bass and forward vocals. The soundstage is open and airy. They remind me of Moondrop Spring Tips with a sturdier cap and shorter stem. Vocals can sound sibilant and piercing when matched with bright earphones, so be very careful with your pairings.

If you don’t look closely, this eartip looks almost identical to Radius Deep Mount. It has the Beefeater bearskin shape which is wide on top and narrow at the bottom. Quite a transparent sounding eartip I must say. Sounds brighter than Deep Mount with slightly less bass. Korean Radius Deep Mount? Not suitable piercing or lean sounding IEMs.

This wide-bore eartip has rapidly become a favourite of mine. It builds on the already impressive Standard Divinus Velvet by adding a touch more treble extension, without venturing into harsh territory. The lower registers are noticeably cleaner, with improved separation from the midrange. This effectively eliminates the muddiness I previously experienced with the Standard Velvet.

But the improvements extend beyond just clarity. The soundstage also takes a significant leap forward. Everything feels more open and spacious, with a clear sense of air between each instrument in the mix. It’s as if you’ve been transported to a larger venue with a more defined acoustic space.

Many reviewers have drawn comparisons between this eartip and the Eletech Baroque, finding them broadly similar. I concur with this assessment to a degree. However, the Wide Velvet offers a smoother sonic presentation with a better-controlled low-end response. In comparison, the Baroque can exhibit a touch of sharpness at times. Soundstage is another area where the Wide Velvet excels. It creates a perceptibly deeper and more expansive listening environment, almost like the music has more room to breathe.

Comfort-wise, both eartips are on par. However, a consistent issue I’ve encountered with the Baroque is the material’s excessive softness and thinness. This unfortunately leads to the eartips turning inside out whenever I take them off, which can be quite annoying. Some of my friends encountered poor ear-seal because of this. Nonetheless, it’s a minor complaint, but one the Wide Velvet has avoided thanks to its more robust construction.

It presents clean yet balanced sound signature with a large soundstage, both width and depth, and good imaging. Perfect match for planar IEMs (these are attached permanently to my Timeless and Timeless AE). My only complain is they have an awkward fit and can be uncomfortable for some people. Comes in a plastic storage case with 3 pairs of your chosen size. Good stuff!

Different from EarrBond New Hybrid series, Barreleye eartips use a sturdy silicone core which give an surprisingly good seal without the squishy feel of foam. Similar to the New Hybrid series, sound is laid back. Barreleye Blue has better clarity, instrument separation, treble extension, stage depth and layering than Barreleye Green and New Hybrid.

However due to its emphasis in the upper-midrange and treble regions, Barreleye Blue isn’t suitable for bright, sibilant or harsh sounding earphones. Group member Vannak Pech described the sound as if “when you apply contrast filter to your image…”.

At US$50 for two pairs (mimimum order quantity is 2 pairs), these hybrid eartips are one of the most expensive eartips in my collection. Equally as comfortable as original EarrBond EBT eartips and feels softer than Pentaconn COREIR Brass eartips. Isolation is exceptional. Are they worth US$25 a pair? Frankly, no! Performance is on par with silicone eartips such as Final Type E and Divinus Velvet. However, if you are looking for foam-level isolation with upper-midrange clarity, look no further. The difference between copper and stainless steel is copper eartips sound warmer and fuller. The vocals are more intimate also.

Safety concerns: Since the metal cores are inserted halfway into the nozzle. It may accidentally slipped out and leave inside the ear canal… Let’s say I am paranoid.

EarrBond is softer and more squishy compared to other hybrid eartips, thus more comfortable for long-listening sessions. The moment you put them on, they simply disappear into your ear canals. Furthermore, they isolate well too. Sound-wise these are a bit too laid back for my taste. Also, I could detect some sibilance on a some female vocal tracks. In term of wearing comfort and isolation, this win hands down.

Sound-wise, it is neutral tonality with emphasis in upper-bass and midrange regions (which adds body) as well as in vocals. I rank these higher than SpinFit CP-145 and on-par with Final Audio Type-E (black) eartips. Everybody should get these eartips if they ever come across it.

I will like to thank Jeremy Phua for bringing this eartips to my attention. Japanese consumer electronics brand Elecom is relatively unknown outside of Asia. But even in Singapore (where I live), Elecom products are uncommon.

Some online rumours claimed that Tanchjim includes this as the stock eartips with some of their IEMs. I have the stock eartips from Tanchjim Tanya. After comparing both, my conclusions are they look “quite” similar but sound different.

Nonetheless, this eartip sounds energetic but balanced overall. My only gripe is that vocals can sound a bit strident and nasally. Not as refined as Acoustune AET07 or SpinFit CP-100.

These eartips are so soft and smooth, they feel like luxury! The texture is similar to Divinus Velvet eartips. They suppress the mid-bass and bring the midrange and upper midrange forward, making them perfect for warm or muddy sounding IEMs. The soundstage is wide, deep, and tall, giving a sense of space around every instrument and artist.

My only gripe is that the silicone material feels thin, which affects the ear seal and isolation.

Compared to Azla SednaEarFit (Light) Short eartips, the Azlas have better low-end punch, vocal clarity, and airiness. The Baroque eartips sound smoother overall.

Compared to Moondrop Spring Tips eartips, the Spring Tips have more vocal presence and are clearer and cleaner. However, the Baroque eartips sound more organic, have better tonal weight, and are less fatiguing.

Overall, the Baroque is a great addition to any eartip collection.

This highly distinctive eartip is likely one of the most anticipated eartips of 2024. If you have struggled to acquire the Lizer Lab JIJU-JETs from Japan or dislike their unusual fit or are sensitive to their “cold-metal-in-ears” sensation, then you might consider giving the ePro Propeller a try. The fit is comfortable but shallow, making it unsuitable for IEMs with short nozzles. I get around this problem by using bigger ear tips, which come in a pack of three sizes.

Sonically, it offers perhaps the widest soundstage outside of the JIJU-JETs. Additionally, the sound localisation is forward-facing with precise imaging create a captivating listening experience. Midrange is clean and velvety, with vocals exhibiting good tonal weight, particularly for female voices which sound exceptionally sweet. Treble is smooth and extended. My only criticism is the low end. It attenuates the mid-bass slightly too much, resulting in a lack of punch and dynamics.

The price of liquid silicone ear tips has fallen significantly in recent years, making products such as the EPZ M100 accessible to a broader range of budget-conscious audiophiles. The M100 delivers a clean and clear sound signature without compromising too much bass depth.

Compared to the Softears Liquid Silicone Ear Tips, the M100 presents a less prominent vocal delivery. The midrange and treble are slightly recessed and softer, with a reduced bass impact. Soundstage is broadly comparable between the two. However, when juxtaposed with the Azla SednaEarfit Crystal, there is no competition; the Crystal is unequivocally superior, boasting superior tonal balance and detail retrieval.

My primary criticism of the M100 lies not with its sonic performance, but rather its thin and flimsy construction. The material is so soft and pliable that the ear tip often inverts upon removal from the ear canal. On a positive note, unlike many liquid silicone ear tips, these do not accumulate dirt or dust.

Soundstage slightly wider than XELASTEC but imaging is less precise. SureSeal does not suffer from the upper-midrange ring that plagues XELASTEC especially with DD-based earphones.

I have been asked to compare the FiiO HS20 and the EPZ M100 on numerous occasions. While both offer excellent value for money, I ultimately prefer the HS20.

I have tested quite a few liquid silicone eartips over the past two years, and the SoftEars Liquid Silicone Eartips have long been my favourite. I am pleased to announce that the FiiO HS20 are now my new favourites for several reasons. Firstly, the bass performance is the best I have heard, even better than with SoftEars. It offers the right amount of tactility and note weight without sounding heavy or loose. The midrange is smooth with the right amount of texture and detail. Vocals sit on a level plane, which is rare among liquid silicone eartips. Most of them push the vocals too forward, making female vocals sound sibilant. Although the treble isn’t as extended as other liquid silicone eartips, this makes everything sound more balanced. Comfort is excellent. I have never once experienced a seal break or fatigue while wearing them. My only complaint is that FiiO only offers them in a single size.

Is this US$7 per pair Chinese-made TPE eartip comparable to Azla SednaEarFits XELASTEC and Fender SureSeal? I am sorry to say the H270 eartip doesn’t feel and wear like a TPE eartip. Thus, I do suspect it isn’t made of TPE at all. Probably made of silicone at best. Nonetheless, H270 is a very lively-sounding eartip. Bass is quite punchy.

Sub-bass rumble is good. Midrange is crisp and clear. Treble extension is very good. Soundstage and imaging are good. If you can overlook the fact that this isn’t made of TPE like they claimed, this is a pretty decent eartip. In terms of sound, it is closer to SureSeal than XELASTEC.

First thing you will notice is how boomy and wooly the bass is. It is so bad that it bleeds into the mids. Upper treble is rolled-off, thus lacking a sense of space and openness. All-in-all, the H370 is a dark-sounding eartip with poor technicalities. Comfort-wise is quite good though. What a pity!

Hiby WG01 Waveguide Tube Liquid Silicone Eartips

Soundstage: 4.50

I have been asked to compare the Hiby WG01 and the EPZ M100 on several occasions. While both offer excellent value for money, I ultimately prefer the M100.

The WG01 is a clear and detailed performer, with a particularly impressive treble extension. However, I found the midrange to be a bit lacking in warmth and body, which can make certain genres of music sound a little too thin and dry. The bass is also on the lighter side compared to the M100, which may not suit listeners who prefer a more pronounced low-end.

The soundstage of the WG01 is somewhat intimate, with a particular emphasis on the forward presentation of female vocals. While this can be appealing for certain genres, it can also lead to a slightly bright and shouty sound.

In terms of comfort and fit, the WG01 is a clear winner due to its wider cap and longer stem. The eartips fit my ears more securely than those of the M100, which can be a significant factor in long listening sessions. However, this advantage is somewhat offset by the WG01’s brighter sound signature, which can be fatiguing over time.

These eartips, likely made by TPE (thermoplastic elastomer), offer surprising competition to the Azla SednaFit Crystal eartips. At only $10 for three pairs, they deliver performance that rivals the Crystal’s, with just a slight decrease in the emphasis of bass and sub-bass notes. However, the true strength of these TPE eartips lies in their exceptional clarity, resolution, and ability to create a wide soundstage. My one complaint is that the material feels a bit too rigid and produces a cracking noise whenever I move my jaw

The Infiter IE45 eartips are designed primarily for True Wireless earbuds, but they can also be used with traditional In-Ear Monitors.

This is achieved through the unique properties of graphene, a material known for its excellent damping properties. The IE45 eartips offer good value for the price. They provide a significant improvement in sound quality for both TWS earbuds and IEMs, without breaking the bank.

While primarily advertised for TWS earbuds, the Infiter IE45Pro eartips can also be used with traditional IEMs. They offer a smooth and balanced sound signature that prioritizes clarity. The Clear version delivers a smooth and non-fatiguing sound profile. However, certain listeners might find that vocals, especially female vocals, can take on a slightly nasal quality. The treble range lacks a bit of sparkle and vibrancy, which can make the sound feel a bit dull or veiled. The soundstage feels somewhat compressed, meaning the instruments may not seem as spacious or separated as with other eartips. Despite the mentioned limitations, IE45Pro Clear offers good value for the price. They provide a decent overall sound experience.

Although these are stated for TWS, they can be used on normal IEMs but with a caveat. This eartip is a fine example of why TWS eartips aren’t so appealing for high-fidelity use. Because of their short stem, many TWS eartips have the tendency to push vocals and upper midrange too forward, making them shouty. Sub-bass, bass and mid-bass take a back seat. Good match for muddy-sounding earphones. Do take note that TPE eartips are dust and dirt magnet. They will deform and lose its shape over time.

These eartips are constructed from very thin and soft silicone and unfortunately these contribute to a poor fit. They struggle to stay securely in place and are prone to flipping over during use, compromising both comfort and sound quality. The thin material significantly impacts the sound signature. The overall sound comes across as bright and lacking in body. Bass frequencies are noticeably suppressed, resulting in a weak and underwhelming low-end experience. The lack of “punch” and “noteweight” refers to the absence of impact and definition in the bass notes, leaving the sound overall thin and hollow. Not recommended.

These eartips are identical to the INfiter W38 model but come in a light blue color. While constructed from soft, thin silicone for comfort, this material unfortunately contributes to a poor fit in the ear. They struggle to stay secure and tend to flip out during use, negatively impacting both comfort and sound quality. The thinness of the material also significantly impacts the sound signature. The overall sound becomes bright and lacks body, with noticeably suppressed bass frequencies. Overall, due to the poor fit and compromised sound quality, these eartips are not recommended.

An incredibly unique eartip that resembles a whiskey barrel with the entire stem fully concealed within the reversed cap, which forms a dome. It is extremely comfortable, isolates and seals very well. Because sound is reflected into the dome, it has an echo (reverb) effect. This presents a wide soundstage with particularly good height and depth. Unfortunately, this echo effect causes vocals, female voices especially, to sound nasally and wheezy. As if the singer is singing with his or her nose pinched. Without a doubt, the iReep 01 is the most unusual eartip in my collection.

Double-flange eartips with wide bores are a rarity. The Acoustune AET06 series is another example of such eartips that I’ve reviewed. In comparison, the ONYX double-flange eartips deliver a brighter, clearer, and more open sound signature. However, they also significantly reduce low and mid-bass frequencies, sacrificing dynamics in the process. While this is ideal for those seeking to reduce bass bloat or muddiness, it makes them less suitable for bright or lean-sounding IEMs. The thin flange material tends to curl upwards when removed from the ears.

It’s been a while since JVC, now known as Victor, graced us with a new eartip design. The Victor Spiral Dot Pro offers a compelling evolution over the existing Spiral Dot series. Beyond the signature, strategically placed dimples within the core, the Pro version introduces a series of minute bumps on this tried-and-tested formula. The result? An even smoother midrange and a more extended treble response compared to the standard Spiral Dots. Bass frequencies benefit from a heavier note weight, with sub-bass extension delivering a satisfying rumble that adds a touch more tactility to the sound. Vocals, in turn, gain a fuller body and a more nuanced dimension.

When compared to the Spiral Dot++, the Pro version boasts a silkier upper-midrange. This tames the occasionally harsh, metallic timbre that can sometimes plague brass instruments and guitars with steel strings.

On the downside, the soundstage projection with the Pro version is narrower and somewhat shorter. Additionally, the mid-bass has a thicker profile, which may not be ideal for earphones that already have a very warm sonic signature.

The Victor Spiral Dot Pro offers a compelling evolution for those who appreciate the comfort and sound provided by the original Spiral Dots. The smoother treble, midrange, enhanced sub-bass, and richer vocals are all welcome improvements.

Linksmith, a company well-known for their high-quality cables, has recently ventured into the world of eartips with their new liquid silicone offering. These eartips join a growing market of similar products, including the EPZ M100 and FiiO HS20.

Despite their thin, delicate appearance, these Linksmith eartips are surprisingly sturdy and comfortable to wear. They fit securely in the ear and provide a comfortable seal, isolating external noise effectively.

In terms of sound, these eartips offer a balanced and neutral sound profile with a slight emphasis on clarity and detail. While they may not deliver the deepest, most powerful bass, they provide a tight, controlled low-end that is well-defined and textured. The midrange is clear and articulate, allowing vocals and instruments to shine through. The treble is airy and extended, offering a sense of openness and spaciousness.

It’s worth noting that these eartips may not be ideal for those who prefer a more bass-heavy sound. Additionally, they may exacerbate sibilance when used with IEMs that already have a bright or forward treble. Moreover, their availability can be limited, making them somewhat difficult to acquire.

The effects on some earphones are prominent while others are not as outstanding.

Nonetheless, vocal is extremely clean. Bass is slightly recessed (compared to conventional silicone eartips such has Final Audio Type E), nonetheless still sounds full and weighty. Treble extension is good. Soundstage and stereo imaging are exceptional. Pairs well with neutral-warm sounding earphones.

Have you ever encountered those quirky inventions that leave you wondering? I recently discovered something in the audio realm that does just that – unusual eartips from Japan promising a completely transformed listening experience.

These eartips, created by LIZER LAB, aren’t your typical silicone pieces. They feature a patented metal “phase plug” that aims to reposition the sound, creating an effect the company calls “out-of-head localisation.” They suggest the music will project outward, mimicking a live concert experience. Naturally, I was intrigued – was this a genuine innovation or clever marketing? After some testing, I have to say the results are intriguing, but inconsistent. The effect varies depending on the earphones used.

The JIJU-JET3 is a subtly revised version of the JIJU-JET2, with a rounded phase plug and larger vent. With these eartips, vocals gain impressive clarity and presence, creating an almost 3D effect. The soundstage feels wider and more spacious, allowing instruments to shine. Bass becomes tighter but lighter. Upper frequencies gain a pleasant sparkle. However, a slight metallic sharpness remains, particularly noticeable with female vocals.

LIZER LAB JIJU-JET3 eartips come with a premium price tag – around 3,780 Japanese Yen (approximately US$26). For audiophiles seeking a unique sonic experience with a touch of experimentation, these eartips might be a worthwhile curiosity and certainly a conversation starter with fellow audio enthusiasts.

Stem length: not applicable
Feel: sturdy and firm
Bass: 4.50

Treble: 4.75
Soundstage: 5.00
Vocal presence: 5.00

Given that the JIJUFIN, JIJUJET, and JIJUJET-2 are no longer in production, I shall focus on comparing the JIJUMA to the JIJUJET-3. The most striking difference lies in the low-frequency response. The JIJUMA’s bass is deeper, richer, and packs a more substantial punch. Its midrange is also more detailed and immersive, and the vocal thinness of earlier models is a thing of the past. While the treble remains similar, Lizer Lab has successfully tamed the metallic edge that used to be a bit harsh. The signature “out-of-head localization” is still there, making each instrument and voice feel like it’s in its own space within the expansive soundstage.

The comfort level of these earphones has been significantly improved over their predecessors. The metal phase plugs, now set further back, prevent any unpleasant contact with the sensitive inner ear. Moreover, the absence of sharp or pointed tips ensures a secure and comfortable fit, minimizing the risk of accidental discomfort or injury.

I had the chance to chat with Mr. Sanpei, the brilliant mind behind Lizer Lab. He was incredibly excited about the JIJUMA and assured me that I would love them. And he was absolutely right. These quirky eartips are a massive upgrade that any serious audiophile should give them a listen.

Telling the difference between the JIJUMA and JIJUMA-BRASS eartips might sound easy, but it’s actually a bit tricky. Both are great, with similar sound qualities. However, the JIJUMA-BRASS adds a touch of warmth and richness, especially in the midrange. This makes voices and acoustic instruments sound a bit fuller and more detailed.

In the upper frequency range, the JIJUMA-BRASS sounds a bit more open and airy. Nonetheless, it’s crucial to acknowledge that these distinctions are inherently subjective and can vary depending on individual listening preferences and the specific in-ear monitors being used.

Treble has good sparkle and crisp, however it lacks that last bit of extension and airiness. Great match for earphones with too much mid-bass or has bleeding mid-bass. The caps are too soft in my opinion. They flap over every time I remove them from my ears, which is very annoying.

These are probably the smoothest eartips I have tried. Its relaxed and delicate sound is neither harsh nor strident. Low-end has good body and punch. Midrange has that silky “tube-like” tonality. Upper-registers are fluid and gentle. Soundstage and imaging are average. Boy… It feels like I am having a head massage every time I listen to these. Very comfortable both in sound and in fitment. Highly recommended!

Similar to TFZ “Pumpkin” and SoundMAGIC Silicone Eartips (For Sports), these eartips are shaped like jack-o’-lanterns. They suppress bass and sub-bass like nobody’s business. Their “enhanced” upper-midrange and treble are the two main reasons why people would buy them. Then again, these look more like Halloween novelty items than proper audio products. The soundstage is open and airy but lacks depth and dimension. Great eartips to sabotage your basshead friend.

Do take note that these eartips fit smaller than normal (I am wearing Large instead of my usual Medium). The “003” on the case does remind me of something that is also rubbery and made of latex. Nonetheless, this eartip has a clear and sparkly presentation especially in the upper-mids and treble. Bass and midbass are attenuated. Unsuitable for bright and lean sounding earphones.

In terms of sound presentation, these vibrant orange eartips deliver the most dynamic and punchy performance I’ve encountered thus far. The bass extension, elasticity, and textural detail are truly exceptional, exceeding any other eartips I’ve tried.

However, it’s important to note that vocal clarity and treble extension suffer slightly compared to the Black version of the Liqueur eartips. Despite this, the overall sound remains fun and engaging, making them a compelling option for listeners who prioritize bass impact and energy.

Pentaconn COREIR AL ALLOY (Aluminum Alloy) Core Eartips (PTM02)

Stem length: long
Feel: firm, sturdy and grippy

Bass: 3.50
Midrange: 5.00
Treble: 4.50
Soundstage: 3.75
Vocal presence: 4.50

A new addition to the COREIR Metal Core family, the COREIR AL Alloy eartips feature a durable aluminum alloy core with a sleek black alumite coating. Compared to the COREIR BRASS, these eartips deliver a warmer, smoother, and more relaxed sound signature. They emphasize a thicker, more pronounced note presentation, while vocals retain clarity within the mix. You may notice a slightly reduced soundstage, meaning the sense of space and instrument separation might feel less expansive. However, the AL-Alloy variant notably reduces the upper-midrange harshness some experienced with the COREIR BRASS model. Overall, these eartips offer a distinct sound profile within the COREIR series, and the aluminum construction should hopefully provide greater resistance to oxidation and tarnishing compared to the brass version.

Bass: 3.50
Midrange: 5.00
Treble: 5.00
Soundstage: 3.50
Vocal presence: 4.75

At 3,850 Japanese Yen (US$35) for 2 pairs of eartips, the COREIR is currently the second most expensive eartip in my collection right now (most expensive is the Sony EP-NI1000M). However, is it worth the high-price it is asking for? Personally, I say “no” and here are the reasons… 

I find the COREIR eartip only suitable for certain types of IEM, particularly those with a very warm, very fully low-end and a recessed midrange, such as the Acoustune HS1650.

When used on Harman-tuned IEMs such as the Tanchjim Oxygen, Salnotes Zero or TangZu Wan’er, the COREIR thins midbass, pushes the midrange and vocals a tad too forward to my liking. Also, occasionally it can sound shouty and nasally especially on female vocal tracks. 

Because of its forward presentation, I find the soundstage a bit narrow. Air and separation around the instruments isn’t as spacious  or as defined as I expected.

Comfort-wise, COREIR falls in between Moondrop Spring Tips and Azla SednaEarFit XELASTEC, although not as grippy as the latter. However, because of the brass core, having the correct fit is crucial… More than ordinary silicone eartips in fact. Just like many TPE eartips, these can heat up the inner-ear and cause discomfort. 

I was disappointed to be honest… But some of you may find good use with the COREIR. I know quite a few reviewers like it.

The Radius Deep Mount Zone, codenamed “HP-DME22”, is the newest member of the acclaimed Deep Mount eartips family. While visually similar to the Radius Deep Mount Clear (Antibacterial) with its transparent design, the Deep Mount Zone distinguishes itself with a grippier, firmer texture. Sonically, the Radius Deep Mount Zone shines in its presentation of vocals. It delivers a clear, forward-sounding vocal performance that enhances the human voice without an overly aggressive, “in-your-face” quality. Beyond vocals, the overall sound signature remains largely consistent with other Deep Mount eartips. While those who already own the Radius Deep Mount Clear may not experience a groundbreaking upgrade with the Zone, the Deep Mount family continues to stand out as one of the most sonically transparent eartips options available.

Very pricey eartips from Softears. Appearance and texture feel just like SednaEarfit XELASTEC, although it says “Liquid Silicone”. Frankly, I have no clue what liquid silicone is other than those used in aesthetics surgery.

However, I find these eartips sound very much cleaner, clearer and airier than both XELASTEC and Crystal. Midrange and vocal presentation are outstanding. Softears Liquid Silicone does not have the upper-midrange “ringing” that plagues the original XELASTEC eartips. Unfortunately, these eartips attracts dirt and dust just like XELASTEC, so clean them regularly if you decide to try.

This is the most expensive eartips in my collection as of October 2021. These tips retail for US$20 A PAIR! Yes, you hear that right… Two Hamiltons for a pair of eartips!

Deemed to be a replacement for Sony Triple Comfort (EP-TC50), these are eartips with an attitude. They sound like silicone but seal and isolate like a good pair of foam tips. Extremely comfortable and stable fit.

Are they better than XELASTEC? All I can say is both are very different. If you are always a “foam person”, the EP-NI1000 sounds more lively and open than, say, Comply or Dekoni.

Heard from a friend that these eartips don’t last long, so it is better to keep them dry and away from heat. Purchased from Amazon, Japan

Slight improvement over the original CP-100 especially in the midrange and upper-midrange. However, I feel the top-end is less airy than CP-100. Bass also lacks a bit of punch and dynamics. The “plus” addendum probably comes from the better portrayal of the human voice. True enough, vocals sound slightly more forward and crispier.

SpinFit OMNI is the direct successor to the CP-360, with a longer nozzle stem and the distinction of being the first SpinFit product to offer “in-between” sizes, which are common among eartip brands such as JVC Spiral Dot and Azla SednaEarFit.

Compared to the CP-360, the OMNI delivers a thumpier bass response with heavier note weight, forward vocals with good clarity, and treble extension that is slightly less pronounced.

Compared to the W1, the OMNI has a shallower fit and does not provide as good of an ear seal. The low end of the W1 is also more substantial. However, the OMNI offers better vocal clarity, cleaner and crispier highs, and a slightly deeper soundstage.

A hybrid between XELASTEC and Moondrop Spring Tips, SpinFit W1 gives superb clarity, improves soundstage and stereo imaging and cleans up bass and mid-bass. However, I find it unsuitable for bright or harsh-sounding earphones. May exaggerates metallic timbre if and when implemented incorrectly.

This is Symbio W with a softer stem. Because of this, I feel that Symbio Wa doesn’t put as much pressure in the ear can thus slightly more comfortable than other oranges. Sonic-wise, both are similar.

Bass: 4.5
Midrange: 4.5
Treble: 4.5 
Soundstage: 3.75

Simply put it, a hexagonal-shaped internal wall of the nozzle that Tanchjim claims “enhance the comfortness (is there such a word?) by evenly balancing the air pressure inside the ear canal, thus to prevent swelling of the ear canal caused by prolonged use of earphone”

… Marketing aside, the T300T (Treble Enhancing) eartip does pushes some high frequency through but it causes the entire bass spectrum and low-mids to “muddle up”, resulting in a loss of texture and low-end details. Does not go well with “thick-sounding” IEMs but good match for leaner-sounding ones BUT be very careful as it might brighten sound too much.

… Marketing aside, the T300T (Treble Enhancing) eartip is surprisingly neutral despite the “Treble Enhancing” name tag. I find the vocal slightly laid-back and lower-mids a tad muffled. Otherwise, a good choice for IEMs with diffused-field tuning, such as those from Tanchjim and Moondrop.

TangZu Tang Sancai Advanced Eartips (Narrow Bore)
Bore size: very narrow

Feel: Firm and pliable. Very sturdy
Bass: 3.25
Midrange: 3.00
Treble: 3.00
Soundstage: 3.50
Vocal presence: 3.00
The Sancai Narrow Bore eartips offer a visually striking departure from the standard eartip design. Their ‘safari hat’ inspired cap, adorned with a textured surface, is undoubtedly eye-catching and adds a touch of individuality to any audio setup. However, this aesthetic appeal is unfortunately where the product’s strengths end.

The audio performance of the Sancai Narrow Bore eartips is a considerable letdown. A pervasive muffling effect obscures the soundstage, robbing instruments and vocals of their detail and clarity. The treble response is particularly underwhelming, with a pronounced roll-off that dulls the overall presentation. This is especially noticeable in tracks with prominent high-frequency content, such as cymbals or female vocals. The result is a fatiguing listening experience that lacks the energy and excitement that music should inspire.

While the eartips offer a decent fit for my ears, it’s important to note that this may vary between individuals. A friend of mine has encountered difficulties achieving a proper seal, despite persistent attempts to adjust and push the eartips. This suggests that the fit may not be universally accommodating.

The TangZu Sancai Narrow Bore eartips are a prime example of style over substance. While their distinctive appearance may appeal to some, their audio performance falls far short of what is expected from a modern eartip.

Tang Sancai (唐三彩), known as “Tang Dynasty three-color ware,” refers to a type of glazed ceramic pottery that originated in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). The term “Sancai” (三彩) translates to “three colors” in Chinese, which refers to the typical color palette used in this type of pottery. Characterized by its distinctive tricolor glaze, Tang Sancai pottery consists of a combination of yellow, green, blue, and white colors, which explains why these eartips come in yellow (Small), green (Medium), and blue (Large).

These eartips are upper midrange forward with a sense of clarity and space, without sacrificing tonal weight. I prefer this to Tang Sancai balanced eartips. Compared to my reference – the SpinFit CP-145, Tang Sancai wide bore sounds cleaner, clearer and has more texture. Treble extension is much better, providing more space around the instruments.

Compared to the crowd favorite – TRI Clarion, Tang Sancai wide bore sounds less open and not as crisp. Soundstage is a tinge narrower as well. However, it has a heavier note weight than Clarion.

The final comparison is with Moondrop Spring Tips. Here is where both eartips share more similarities. Both eartips are upper-mid forward but Tang Sancai wide bore sounds a tad smoother and less sibilant. It also seals better in my ears but fit is subjective.

Do take note that my audiophile buddy broke one of his Tang Sancai wide bore eartips while trying them the first time. Be very careful when swapping tips.

The term “Sancai” (三彩) translates to “three colors” in Chinese, which refers to the typical color palette used in this type of pottery. Characterized by its distinctive tricolor glaze, Tang Sancai pottery consists of a combination of yellow, green, blue, and white colors, which explains why these eartips come in yellow (Small), green (Medium), and blue (Large).

These eartips are vocal forward, full-bodied, and bass-heavy, with an average soundstage projection and a slight top-end congestion. Compared to my usual reference, the SpinFit CP-145, Tang Sancai sounds bassier, more robust, and fuller. Vocals are pushed forward with a bit of nasal undertone, especially on husky female vocals, such as Patricia Barber. Treble extension is much better on the CP-145, providing more space for instruments to breathe.

When compared to Acoustune AET07 and its 07 variants, both eartips become more similar. However, to my ears, AET07 sounds cleaner and clearer. On the other hand, Tang Sancai sounds bolder, with thumpier bass and smoother overall sound.

The last comparison is with Final Audio Type-E. To me, Final Type-E is like a glass of smooth, rich, and creamy oak-aged whiskey. Tang Sancai’s full-bodied presentation can’t match Type-E’s. However, Tang Sancai excels in vocal projection, has slightly better treble extension, and delivers a snappier mid-bass thump. In terms of soundstage, Final Type-E is better but not by much.

Shaped like a white pumpkin, these eartips suppress bass and sub-bass like nobody’s business. Their “enhanced” upper-midrange and treble are the two main reasons why people would buy them. Then again, these look more like Halloween novelty items than proper audio products. Soundstage is open and airy but lacks depth. Overall, sound transparency is surprisingly good. Great eartips to sabotage your basshead friend.

These eartips were surprisingly inexpensive, which rather took me aback. Let me first introduce Tianlai Acoustics. They are a small Chinese Hi-Fi manufacturer specialising in earbuds (yes, earbuds, not IEMs). Their product line-up currently only features one bullet-style IEM. The company has little to no recognition outside of Mainland China.

Now, onto the eartips themselves. They’re incredibly soft and fit my ears very well, causing no discomfort whatsoever. In terms of sound, they offer a balanced presentation with a touch of bass emphasis and punch. The midrange is delightfully smooth, with excellent vocal projection. The treble is clean, crystal clear, and well-extended, with no harshness or piercing. These eartips don’t just offer comfort; they also deliver a well-defined soundstage, creating a sense of spaciousness in your music. For listeners who prioritize a balanced sound with clear vocals and a good amount of bass, these eartips are a fantastic choice.

These are probably the most sibilant eartips I have tested so far thus avoid using them on earphones that sound bright and tizzy. These eartips reduce mid-bass and sub-bass to the point whereby there is very little bass rumble. Vocals are pushed forward. Of all the traits, what impresses me most is the huge soundstage they project.

Listening to these eartips is like having a thick veil covers the entire frequency spectrum. They simply muffle sound! Bass is clumpy, lacks texture and details. Midrange and upper-registers cover by a layer of haze. Vocal is lackluster and lifeless. Staging is flat and narrow. Imagining is fuzzy. One of the worst eartips I have tested so far.

These onion-shaped eartips fit smaller and shorter than, say, SpinFit. Overall tonality is upper-midrange and treble emphasis, with a hint of boosted bass. Vocal presence is good but forward and sibilant, so be careful when pairing with bright-sounding IEMs. Soundstage is spacious with good depth and height.

Made of the same transparent liquid silicone material as Softears UC eartips but at a lower cost. I find these tulip-shaped eartips sound clean, clear and airy. Midrange, vocal presentation, and soundstage are outstanding. Bass and mid-bass are on the lean side. Unfortunately, these eartips attract dirt and dust, so clean them regularly if you use them frequently.

WARNING: Due to its EXTREMELY short stem, DO NOT use earphones with short nozzle.

It isn’t a typo error. The bass score is 0.00, meaning ZERO bass. Vented means no seal. Without a good ear-seal, bass disappears. There is no noise isolation as well. Other than vent holes on the cap, it is the same eartip as standard Unique Melody Liquid Silicone Ear Tips with SHOUTY upper registers!

These latex eartips remind me of FEAULLE H570 latex eartips but cost a fraction less and come in 3 size-pairs per box. Overall tonality is bright and lively. Bass is girthier than H570 with a good thump. Vocals are sibilant but give particularly good enunciation. Stage and imaging are quite good. Resolves nuances very well. Fit and comfort are good. These don’t feel sticky or attract dust like Azla SednaEarFit XELASTEC.

Zeo’s Render hybrid eartips offer a compelling combination of comfort and exceptional isolation, surpassing the softness of Symbio W tips. Their bass performance takes center stage, delivering a punchy and satisfying low-end without the mid-bass bloat common in many foam eartips. In terms of sound signature, they closely resemble the very expensive Sony EP-N1000M, albeit with a slight compromise in upper-midrange clarity. Compared to Zeo’s other favorite, the Dekoni Bulletz foam tips, the Render eartips offer a significant boost in clarity, vocal presence, and bass impact.

Stem length: regular
Feel: firm and elastic

Bass: 3.75
Midrange: 4.50
Treble: 4.50
Soundstage: 5.00
Vocal presence: 4.00

These eartips initially debuted alongside the 7Hz Aurora IEM, and they quickly garnered attention. While reminiscent of Dunu S&S eartips, they boast a softer silicone construction that sets them apart. The tapered design, slightly smaller than their Dunu counterparts, offers a more snug and comfortable fit.

Sonically, these eartips deliver a beautifully balanced signature that excels in creating an open, airy soundscape. Compared to the Dunu S&S eartips, you will notice a subtle reduction in bass emphasis, instead favouring extended highs. This results in a lighter, crispier overall presentation, revealing a wealth of texture and subtle nuances in your music. If you’re seeking enhanced clarity and detail, these eartips come highly recommended!

Hi

This is an impressive guide and must have taken a long time to put together. Thanks for your work.

I have a question about the Fiio stock tips you have reviewed as I really enjoy them with the FH3 IEM and some other non-Fiio headphones because the large ones fit me very well and provide excellent isolation.

Do you know if they are a third party brand that can be bought separately (shipping to UK)?

I like the red/grey bass ones and the dark grey balanced in large and would like more plus spares. There’s loads on Amazon the look very similar but there’s no way of knowing. I tried various Spinfit, etc but the isolation is always lacking. It’s a matter of the fit for my ears.

Thanks

Hello,

I found there are discrepancies for these 2 entries, since they should be the same model with different colours.

Final Audio Type E (for TWS)
Bore size: wide
Stem length: short
Feel: soft and sturdy
Bass: 3.25
Midrange: 5.00
Treble: 4.75
Soundstage: 4.50
Vocal presence: 5.00

Quite the opposite of regular Final Type E eartips sonic-wise, These tips intensify upper-mids and treble, which unfortunately, introduces sibilance to female vocals and makes cymbals sound tinny. This can be unpleasant especially when used with bright earphones. Staging and ambience are better than regular Type E. Use with caution!

Overall, similar to Final Type E True Wireless (black) but with slightly less bass.

Thanks for putting together this list. It really helps in tip selection. I wanted to point out something about the Nuarl tips, since I recently bought some of the Block Ear+ 6 tips. The number after the “+” sign refers to stem length, not the bore size. The Block Ear+ 6 has a stem length of 6 mm and a bore size of 4 mm.

i dont see the XELASTEC II information as said in march update. i checked the alphabetic order. also, you should add in here foam tips such as comply or a section for them. also, would be nice for editors picks to narrow down searches and buying etc. maybe even a good place to buy the tips.
